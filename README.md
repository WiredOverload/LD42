Ludem Dare Game Jam 42
Created by WiredOverload and Gizmolo

The Dark Shadow is encroaching and it’s up to Rey to protect last remaining Path of Light!

Controls:
Ship follows your mouse cursor
Click to shoot

How To Play:
Start the game by clicking on the screen
Nodes will begin to spawn from the left and move to the right at a random angle
Your goal is to shoot and destroy the nodes before they attach themselves to the wall
If a node is on a wall and a subsequent node attaches itself to the opposite wall, the shadow will extend itself there
The white lines are your “Tracers” to show where all the nodes are including the ones that are traveling through the shadow
If you are hit by a node or come in contact with the shadow, the game is over
